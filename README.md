##500 City Weather Analysis Dashboard

#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

Completed
## Project Intro/Objective
For this project I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations of weather data from 500 cities that was created during a past project.  

### Methods Used
* Python Data Cleaning, Merging and Loading Data
* Data Visualization 

### Technologies

* Python, Pandas, Jupyter 
* CSV files
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Project Description

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which they can be navigated. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. In addition, I created a page where one can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where someone can view the data used to build them.

The data from the original Weather Analysis did not change, the same data and visualizatins didn't change. The finished project was connected to github.io.
